# Pokéverse Starter

This is a starter template for the Pokéverse project. The data fetching has been done for you (using a custom hook called [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)). **Your job is to focus on the styling.**

Some very basic styles are provided in `src/index.css`, `src/components/Layout/Layout.css`, and `src/components/PokemonCard/PokemonCard.css`. You are encouraged to either write your own CSS (I recommend [MaintainableCSS](https://maintainablecss.com/)) or try a third-party solution:

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) or [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

To stop the server, make sure your terminal window is in focus (the easiest way is to click inside it) and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
